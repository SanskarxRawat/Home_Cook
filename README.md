# HomeCook

---

- HomeCook is a fully designed web application using MERN stack.
- I've used Express.js to architect a standard web application.
- This application uses MongoDB environment and Node.js package called Mongoose to store application's data.
- I've organized application data in Mongoose models as one part of model-view-controller(MVC) architecture.
- I've have applied CRUD(create-read-update-delete) operations.
- I've set up an authentication system to analyze and approve user.
- I've have added sessions and cookies to this application to allow information's to be shared between application server and the user's computer.
- This application can serve data beyond web page that enable it to connect with external services that may use it's data.
- I've created application API that shows the data accessed through API endpoint.
- I've build a live-chat feature which uses Node.js Socket.io that allow user to connect with one another.
